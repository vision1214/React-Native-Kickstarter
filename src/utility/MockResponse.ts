      'For dinner we ordered the shrimp enchiladas, chicken enchiladas, chicken burrito, chimichangas, and steak quesadillas. Everything was so tasty and amazing. I wasnt surprised because the food at the FiDi location is the best so I figured this location would be just as good and it was!!! The enchiladas with the green sauce is to die for. My go to at the FiDi location is usually the chicken enchiladas but I decided to try something new and the shrimp enchiladas did not disappoint.',

      'For dinner we ordered the shrimp enchiladas, chicken enchiladas, chicken burrito, chimichangas, and steak quesadillas. Everything was so tasty and amazing. I wasnt surprised because the food at the FiDi location is the best so I figured this location would be just as good and it was!!! The enchiladas with the green sauce is to die for. My go to at the FiDi location is usually the chicken enchiladas but I decided to try something new and the shrimp enchiladas did not disappoint.',

      'I first heard about this place through Instagram post. The drinks looked creative so I made it a point to give it try while in the city. Located inside American Eagle in Times Square they serve up the coolest non-alcoholic beverages. You have an array of options from tea, soda, coffee, latte, water and more. Theres countertops (with phone chargers) so youre able to stand and enjoy your beverage. This visit I opted for the Pegasus latte which was not only beautiful but tasted just as good as it looked. Great staff and great service. This is a must try if you are in the area. Im sure Ill be back soon!',
